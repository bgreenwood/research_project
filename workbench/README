Description:
The project workbench provides an interactive web-based UI for managing and querying  triplestores/graph databases which support the SPARQL 1.1 Graph Store HTTP Protocol [1]. The workbench enables rapid experimentation through an easily accessible configuration editor, data management tool, graph visualisation tool and query interface. 

This tool is based on an adapted version of the EasyRdf library [2] and a fork of the CodeIgniter PHP Framework [3].

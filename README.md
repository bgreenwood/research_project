Research Project: Building a Research Data Commons on Linked Data
================

The premise of this research project is that Research Data classification, access and reuse can be enhanced by building tools which leverage Linked Data and the Semantic Web to provide discovery and consumption capabilities. We asked the question, to what extent can the expressiveness of semantic web technologies be used to extend research data discovery beyond conventional systems?
